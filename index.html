        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Q: What is the market place and what does it mean to move the cards along the arrow?</b><br>
            A: The market place is the area where the new cards are paced. There is always a total of 8 cards in the market place. The cards in the market place move from the market deck towards the trash pile. At the end of a players turn, slide the cards within the market place in the direction of the trash pile. Then, fill up the market place from the market deck.<br>
            The game material does not include a board for the market place. However, we do offer a printable version of the market place. You can download it <a href="Downloads/market_place.pdf">here</a>.
